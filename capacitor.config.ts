  // SECURITY: pin Capacitor's bridge logging to "none" in every build.
  //
  // WARNING: Capacitor's `loggingBehavior` naming is inverted from what it
  // sounds like. Reading CapConfig.java:290-304:
  //
  //   - "debug"      (default) → loggingEnabled = isDebug
  //                              (log in debuggable builds, silent in release)
  //   - "production"           → loggingEnabled = true
  //                              (ALWAYS log, including release builds — the
  //                              OPPOSITE of what the name implies)
  //   - "none"                 → loggingEnabled = false
  //                              (never log, regardless of build config)
  //
  // We must use "none" to actually suppress Capacitor's bridge traces.
  //
  // Why we care: Bridge.java:826 logs every plugin call at verbose level:
  //   V Capacitor: callback: X, pluginId: Y, methodName: Z, methodData: {...}
  // which writes the full argument payload to logcat / NSLog. Several
  // plugin calls in this app pass wallet seed material through the bridge:
  //
  //   - PasskeyPrf.derivePrfSeed returns the 32-byte PRF entropy.
  //   - NativeVault.storeSeed receives the plaintext mnemonic JSON blob
  //     from NativeSecureStorage.storeSeed.
  //
  // With any setting other than "none", those payloads are written in
  // cleartext to system log files readable by any process with READ_LOGS
  // (granted to many OEM apps on Android, and to Console.app on iOS).
  //
  // Tradeoff: "none" ALSO suppresses WebView console.* → native log
  // bridging (via BridgeWebChromeClient.onConsoleMessage → Logger.info/
  // warn/error, all gated on shouldLog()). Structured logger breadcrumbs
  // from glow-web will no longer appear in logcat. Use the in-app log
  // viewer (Settings → Share Logs) for debugging those paths.
  //
  // This is a defense-in-depth mitigation at the bridge layer. The proper
  // fix is F2 in the follow-ups plan: keep plaintext seed material on
  // the native side of the bridge entirely so this config choice is no
  // longer load-bearing.
  loggingBehavior: 'none',
  // WebView background. Capacitor only calls webView.setBackgroundColor()
  // when this key is present (Bridge.initWebView reads
  // `android.backgroundColor` then falls back to `backgroundColor`, and
  // skips the call entirely when both are null), so leaving it unset
  // leaves the WebView on Chromium's opaque WHITE default. Any region or
  // moment the page canvas does not cover then paints white: the gap
  // between the native splash tearing down and the first web paint, and
  // any layout inset that leaves part of the WebView unpainted.
  //
  // spark-dark (#0f0f18) matches the launch splash canvas, the pre-JS
  // AppTheme.NoActionBar windowBackground, and HomePage's own background,
  // so the whole cold-start hand-off stays one flat color.

  // header is `swift-tools-version: 5.9`, where `.v18` does not exist yet,
  // so raising the deployment target to 18 made every sync emit a package
  // that fails to resolve ("error: 'v18' is unavailable"). This is the

  // nothing to complain about, and every dependency keeps its own tools
  // version (capacitor-passkey-prf is already on 6.0).
